Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?

I really liked being able to use React, and while I didn't get some of the best practices in, I definitely learned a lot. I really appreciated the React Router, and I was able to implement better parts of my app than before. I'm getting used to the ecosystem so I mainly stuck with the Router, Login, Register, and the new player component which comes with a preloaded song. I was also able to provide the user a list of songs that are in their profile. Overall, React gave me a lot of tools I wish I had throughout the course.
